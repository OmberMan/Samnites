That's some pretty fucking progressive morals for an Iron Age civilization. They were known as the strongest individual fighters in the Italian peninsula, and were a regional power that could take on the Greeks, despite their federation being decentralized into four basically independent cantons during times of peace. Each one followed a different sacred creature, as the Samnite religion was distinct from that of other Italic peoples with a strong focus on animals. They're genuinely pretty interesting and underrepresented, I'd check them out.",
